          Who We Are: Pennez means “to think” so we can empower children to
          think as they read. We exist because 65% of all students in the U.S.
          struggle to read by fourth grade, and among African American and
          Latino children, the figure rises to 80%. We support children
          educators and parents by identifying wordsmiths, curating diverse
          stories, developing curricula, and creating innovative software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Purpose: To help improve our speech technology and software, Pennez is
          looking for children to participate (with the Consent of their parent
          or legal guardian) and have their voices recorded while they read
          (either electronically or in person with a tape recorder). This
          Consent has details for you to consider before you give your child
          permission to participate in data collection. When this Consent is
          signed, it confirms our promises to you and gives us your permission
          for Pennez to obtain and use your child’s information. You understand
          this data collection effort is designed to help us learn and to
          improve our speech and voice recognition technology for the benefit of
          Pennez, and users of our products and services. Participation is
          completely up to you, however it is not intended to directly help or
          benefit you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ways to Participate: Pennez is offering a variety of ways to partake
          in this data collection effort, but Pennez has the final discretion to
          determine a child’s eligibility to participate:{" "}
        </p>
        <p> • Pennez is hosting tutoring sessions at select locations/times.</p>
        <p>
          • Pennez is hosting literary events at certain schools and community
          organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Pennez has a web application where your child may submit his/her
          voice recordings using your home computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          • Pennez may host other data collection events and will make this
          information available on its website:
        </p>
        <p>
          Information We Collect: If your child participates in data collection,
          you allow us to collect: (a) recordings and/or audio files containing
          your child’s voice, including speech and voice data; (b) information
          about you, as the child’s parent or legal guardian, which allows us to
          verify this Consent and contact you regarding data collection events
          and logistics; and (c) information about your child in oral, written
          and/or electronic form which is relevant to your child’s reading
          skills and necessary to improve our technology (collectively, your
          “Child’s Information”).{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Leaving Data Collection: If you allow your child to participate now
          and later change your mind, you may end your permission and stop data
          collection at any time (for any reason, and without penalty). If you
          decide to terminate this Consent please contact rebecca@pennez.com. If
          you terminate this Consent, it will only be effective to the extent
          Pennez has not already relied upon it.{" "}
